          Spider-Man centers on student Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) who, after being bitten by a genetically-altered spider,
          gains superhuman strength and the spider-like ability to cling to any surface. He vows to use his abilities to fight
          crime, coming to understand the words of his beloved Uncle Ben: With great power comes great responsibility.

          When a failed nuclear fusion experiment results in an explosion that kills his wife, Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina)
          is transformed into Dr. Octopus, a cyborg with deadly metal tentacles. Doc Ock blames Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) for the
          accident and seeks revenge. Meanwhile, Spidey's alter ego, Peter Parker, faces fading powers and self-doubt.
          Complicating matters are his best friend's (James Franco) hatred for Spider-Man and his true love's (Kirsten Dunst)
          sudden engagement to another man.

          Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and M.J. (Kirsten Dunst) seem to finally be on the right track in their complicated
          relationship, but trouble looms for the superhero and his lover. Peter's Spider-Man suit turns black and takes control
          of him, not only giving Peter enhanced power but also bringing out the dark side of his personality. Peter must overcome
          the suit's influence as two supervillains, Sandman and Venom, rise up to destroy him and all those he holds dear.
